Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to showcase my skills, projects, and experience in web development and digital marketing. The website features a modern and responsive design, including sections for about me, skills, projects, services, and contact. It is designed to provide a seamless user experience across all devices.

ðŸš€ Current Status: The website is fully functional with HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. Future updates will include React for better interactivity, animations, and a dynamic project showcase.

I will continue improving the design, adding new projects, and optimizing performance to enhance the overall experience. Stay tuned for updates! ðŸŽ¯âœ¨
